When was the last time you wanted to switch notes apps — but dreaded migrating all your data?

Every company knows data is valuable — but do you preserve yours? Your reading history, your favorite films, your travels, your five-star meals, your running routes, your thoughts and ideas.

**You own and grow your data. Apps use it, contribute to it — but don't take a cut.**

There's a better way — for users and app builders alike: Data Native.

## Why Your Data Matters More Than Ever

Companies already know what your data is worth.

Netflix uses your watch history to recommend your next binge. Spotify builds playlists from your listening patterns. Amazon predicts what you'll buy. Google serves ads based on your searches. They use *your* data to serve *you* better — and profit from it.

But you can't do the same with your own data.

You can't ask "what books have I read about leadership?" across Kindle, Apple Books, and your handwritten notes. You can't say "find that restaurant I loved in Tokyo three years ago" across Photos, Maps, and journal entries. You can't search your own life.

<!-- TODO: Add more concrete examples of what unified personal data + AI enables -->

Your data is scattered across dozens of apps — and none of them talk to each other. Companies can query your data. You can't.

## The Inversion

Data Native is simple:

**Your data is the environment. Apps are visitors.**

Not the other way around.

- Your data lives in folders you own, in files you can read
- Apps adapt to *your* data — not your data to apps
- Apps can keep caches and indexes — but the source of truth is yours
- If an app dies tomorrow, your data lives on

The folder becomes the platform. Apps become interchangeable.

---

## Why Now

**Apps are disposable. Data isn't.**

Your notes app might get acqui-hired next quarter. The journaling startup might pivot. That photo organizer might just... stop updating. Apps churn. Your data spans decades.

**AI makes adaptive apps possible.**

Apps no longer need rigid schemas. AI can infer your folder structures, understand your naming conventions, tolerate messy organization. The old excuse — "we need to control the format" — no longer holds.

---

## How It Works

**Layer 1: Your Data (Permanent)**

Plain files. Human-readable. Organized however you want. Yours forever.

**Layer 2: App Caches (Disposable)**

Apps keep indexes, embeddings, thumbnails. All rebuildable. Switch apps? The new one rebuilds from your data. No export, no import, no lock-in.

**Layer 3: AI Interpretation (Adaptive)**

Apps use AI to understand *your* organizational style. They adapt to your structure instead of forcing you into theirs.

---

## "But..."

**"Won't apps break if my data is messy?"**
AI handles variation. Plain files are *less* fragile than app databases, not more.

**"Don't apps need databases?"**
For performance, yes. But as caches — not sources of truth. Rebuildable. Disposable.

**"What if I'm not technical?"**
Data Native apps should feel *simpler*. Folders are intuitive. It's today's model — sync conflicts, export formats, migration wizards — that's complicated.

## The Precedent

We've seen this shift before.

"Cloud-native" wasn't just about running code on AWS. It was a mental model flip: the cloud became the environment, servers became disposable.

Data Native is the same inversion — but personal. Your files are the environment. Apps are just interfaces.

## What's Next

If you're building in this space — or thinking about it — I'd love to hear from you.

The future of personal software will be built by people who understand: the best way to serve users is to respect that their data was never ours to own.
