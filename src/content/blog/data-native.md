When was the last time you wanted to switch notes apps — but dreaded migrating all your data?

Every company knows data is valuable — but do you preserve yours? Your reading history, your favorite films, your travels, your five-star meals, your running routes, your thoughts and ideas.

**You own and grow your data. Apps use it, contribute to it — but don't take a cut.**

There's a better way — for users and app builders alike: Data Native.

## Why You Should Own and Grow Your Data

Take a step back, why do we even care about data native?

**Own Your Data**

Own means control, not custody. Compare: App A stores data on your local disk, but in a proprietary format with poor export. App B lets you choose local or cloud, but uses open formats and exports cleanly. Which one gives you more control?

Today most apps offer export options, so vendor lock-in isn't the crisis it once was. The remaining issue is fragmentation: your data is scattered across many apps, and even with exports, pulling it together takes effort.

**Grow Your Data**

If the AI companion of the future ever comes true, data will be essential — and the more you have, the better it can serve you.

Today, companies use your data in shallow ways: your searches and clicks sell you products, your watch history trains recommendation algorithms. Useful, but limited.

Imagine deeper access: your searches, bookmarks, watch history, emails, calendars, messages, notes, photos, the places you go, the people you meet, your sleep, workouts, travels, habits, thoughts, goals. Today this sounds like data hoarding. Tomorrow, it could be what lets an AI truly know you.

As physical and mental labor get automated, what remains distinctly yours — your tastes, thoughts, connections to the real world — could be more valuable than ever.

## What Is Data Native

Today most apps work in data silos — each app has its own database, its own format, its own way of organizing things. Want to switch? Export is the best they can offer.

Data Native proposes:

- You own the source of truth for all your data.
- Data lives in folders of files, in open, common formats.
- You organize folders and structures your way.
- Apps adapt to your data.
- Apps can build caches and indexes for performance, but content goes into your data folder whenever possible.

**Your data is the environment. Apps are visitors.**

## Why Now

In the past, due to technical complexity and business incentives to retain users, apps tended to work in isolation.

**Apps are tiktoking.**

AI coding tools make building apps easier than ever. Apps are becoming more lightweight and transient. We're even seeing instant apps built for a single purpose, used once, then discarded. More apps means more competition — and more shutdowns, pivots, acquihires. Apps come and go. Your data spans decades.

**Rich choices of apps.**

How many notes or fitness apps have you come across and wanted to try? We already have thriving app ecosystems — and AI is accelerating this even further. We'd want effortless switching, or using multiple apps at once — no data loss, no migration hassle.

**AI makes adaptive apps possible.**

Previously, most apps needed rigid structures to work. Only a few, like file explorers, could handle arbitrary user data. Today AI provides a way out, making it possible for more apps to adapt to how you organize things.

**Your data is more usable, thus more valuable.**

Previously, only tech companies had the ability to collect and utilize data at scale. Today with AI, individuals can also derive value from their own data — making it more worthwhile to own and grow.

## How Data Native Works

**Layer 1: Your Data (Permanent)**

Plain files. Human-readable. Organized however you want. Yours forever. Open, common formats — text over proprietary databases, markdown over custom formats. Your data should be readable without the app.

**Layer 2: App Caches (Disposable)**

Apps keep indexes, embeddings, thumbnails. All rebuildable. Switch apps? The new one rebuilds from your data. No export, no import, no lock-in.

**Layer 3: AI Interpretation (Adaptive)**

Apps use AI to understand *your* organizational style. They adapt to your structure instead of forcing you into theirs.

**This already works today.** Obsidian stores your notes as plain markdown files. Immich lets you use external photo libraries. These aren't edge cases — they're early adopters of a pattern that's ready for wider adoption.

## Common Questions

**"Won't apps break if my data is messy?"**
AI handles variation. Plain files are *less* fragile than app databases, not more.

**"Don't apps need databases?"**
For performance, yes. But as caches — not sources of truth. Rebuildable. Disposable.

**"What if I'm not technical?"**
Data Native apps should feel *simpler*. Folders are intuitive. It's today's model — sync conflicts, export formats, migration wizards — that's complicated.
